0,You guys are unprofessional. I am trying to order from last night. You accepted and placed the order but then no update. And this repeated today also. You should inform people that you are not available or restaurants are not taking order.
0,"Your foodpanda riders love to make unnecessary phone calls!! ONLINE order should mean online order and then delivery to the apartment, he has to come and say which apt, the guard will contact the apartment, I have no idea whey they call to say they are in front of the apartment! "
0,"I have sent email to support, no response. live-chat option from Help-center is unavailable on the help list. I was supposed to get a refund and still did not. Is there no customer support of foodpanda?"
0,"I ordered a Chinese menu from khatir and the food quality plus taste was not good on top of that they have served me tandoori chicken instead of fried chicken, this has been going on for a while the other day I ordered grilled chicken and the chicken came out half burnt and there?s nothing left to eat, this is because nowadays foodpanda doesn?t make the restaurants accountable for their poor food service, now food panda doesn?t have anyway to call and complain about the service to the customer care, so from now on I will either cook myself or order food from some other agent or will starve to death, but won?t order anything from you. Pathetic service"

0,Very good behavior from rider ???
0,Favrt..ordered a lot..why wont?t u come my place..Dakhin Khan..After azampur rail crossing??pls come
0,Please make sure your riders comply with the guidelines. They DO NOT wear masks. More importantly they don't know how to handle food. My order of dodhi was carried sideways in this tiny schoolbag by the rider who delivered. You guys need some root-level training for the riders!
1,Thanks foodpanda for excellent service
0,Our trust on foodpanda has broken. They did fraud and cheated to us. Taken advance money from debit card for home delivery but after 5 hours they haven?t delivery the order. Now they are overturning and accusing self picking order? Who should self picking the food during lockdown though ordered through foodpanda? How ridiculous? They are totally fraud.
1,Thank you food panda.....we love you for coming to gopalganj...??????

0,"They daily give many offers and make us greedy about all the tasty food.But most of the offers are fake.When we order after that the man receives the order or they say""your order has been accepted""but even after 2 hrs it stays the same.And even if the man receives the order than also after a couple of minutes it gets cancelled by them.And then if we call the customer care then they say they will check and reply but never reply."

0,"If food is wrong or bad,they don;t give refunds.This is very bad."
0,one of the bestest poor sevice ever
0,"Other food delivery services are much better than this,it kept me waiting for about 2.5 hours and still I did not get the food delivered and took my payment.I suggest that people should stop using this app and find more suitable options."
1,"I haven't used any other services except food delivery.At first,it wasn't good at all.But over time,it improved.at least in my area,mohammadpur.Gave 4 star rating because i know shohoz food section has room for development.For example,if a restaurant is closed or a item is sold out for the day,these are not shown on the app.As a result,both deliveryman and customer has to suffer and time of both are wasted.Please take a look at this and I'll give 5 stars."
0,Bad service and very annoying.
0,0ly they don't have any kind of customer service for their food delivery.

0,"While placing order on prepayment,maximum time delivery man cancelled the order telling that item not available despite item available at restaurant.Complaining at Customer Care,no action is taken.Also money has been blocked for several days i.e refund made after a week."
1,"Shohoz provides excellent service.So far,I am very satisfied with their behaviour.The best part about Shohoz is it has a wide range of options to choose from at reasonable rates.Unlike Foodpanda,which connects one mostly to the expensive restaurants.Shohoz connects its customers even with restaurants offering good food at comparatively lower price.This has given me an opportunity to taste the Biryanis and Pulaos of different restaurants without feeling guilty of over-spending."
0,"Shohoz food has terrible services.Sometimes their rider will tell you that restaurant has no food and request you to cancel order.If you don't do it,they will cancel it.If you already paid the amount by card or bkash,they will assure that will be refunded.But actually they will not.If you complain them regarding not getting the refund,they will say it is under process.During morning time,the rider will bring breakfast so late that you have to leave for office without having the food."
0,"one of the most unprofessional services i have ever used.For food,even if the customer care calls to confirm the order they process it really slowly.And then the delivery man will most likely cancel it.Riders are rude and unprofessional.The delivery service is a joke.I would 100% advice not to use this app to order food.Very poor service quality."
0,"ordered food from their app,they accepted and processed the order and cancelled the order after 45 minutes.It was past office lunch hours and they said'the restaurant was out of stock'.If they were out of stock,why did they take 45 minutes to inform?It takes 45 minutes to deliver the food!utterly 0 by their service and communication."
