pos,Delivery service at its best....
neg,This app and site over charges than other similar services. The delivery takes way longer than the estimated time. The delivery people are rude.

neg,Very late confirmation of orders and very late delivery. Totally neg by their services day by day
neg,They give you promo code but later doesn't accept it then why giving the promo code and making us download the app giving fake promo codes
neg,Service is not good.After taking order they told that restaurent is closed.If you dont know about the restaurent situation then why take order by keeping that restaurent name.U should say unavaiable.Its really very irritating that after ordering u confirm and then tell restaurent is close.

neg,Worst delivery service ever!
neg,"Two times I ordered things & Two times the rider stole the drinks (didn?t bring it). And the last time I prepaid everything via card, and the rider asked for 38 more taka coming home, saying prices went up. Cheaters & thiefs! Stay away from them."
neg,"My order got rejected, but only after i already paid with bkash. Took them about 2neg days to refund the money, but they kept the delivery fee (??). They refunded 46negtk on a 59negtk order. I reallt wanna know what these guys are smoking up there. Atrocious customer service too. Would not recommend."

neg,They gave me time 7negmins but rest is history. Worst experience.
neg,Very bad delivery experience.
neg,Worst Service from their site..!! if you order they will take at least 2hr and after that they will call you and ask for more time..and its not only for exceptional basis..its their regular thing. And their customer service lies to you every time.
neg,What a nasty response by you and your service. The support doesn't respond in time. Even the application is worse. The delivery system is too bad if will order today you will get you delivery tomorrow. Huge delay in delivery..
neg,We need Hungry Naki in Jatrabari. We can't order from Hungry Naki because of we are living in Jatrabari. I installed this app one year ago and i was thinking Hungry Naki definitely do something about Jatrabari for delivering food but one year almost gone Hungry Naki don?t take any action still.
neg,"Worst experience.. I ordered food @ 2.48 pm and gave delivery time @9.posneg pm. At posneg they called and said that they will need pos.pos5 hr more and also they could not deliver my ordered food properly. If you can't manage well then stop your service, don't harass people."
neg,"Fortunately there was no neg stars... After keeping me waited for about an hour they called me at 9:44 pm when nearly all the restaurants are closed and then cancelled my order... Sir you will not be able to continue your scam(what you call your ""service"") for long."
neg,"Ordered food, waited for 2 hours, didn't receive any update or call to let us know anything about it. Expected better service. Hope you can work on these!"
neg,Horrible. Never gonna order anything from here in future. I ordered pos pizza and 2 soft drinks. But they only delivered the pizza. They totally forgot about the drinks. Also the delivery took almost 2 hours.
neg,The worst service. They don't pick up when you call at their number. My order didn't even confirm because I chose bkash option. I mean why keep that option if it's not working. The worst experience ever
neg,Such a bull shite service every time they create some issue and cancel the order after mobile payment.and customer service representative are showing there app are not ready or updating.if hungry naki is not able to deliver food why they are ensure that your order is ready for delivery.
neg,worst food delivery service you can expect. after placing order they call me after posneg minutes and told me we are in rush today so it will take two hours to deliver your food. do they even know what their competition is doing?

pos,Best bangladeshi food delivery service....
neg,I am extremely neg by the poor service. Food that was supposed to be received by 45 minutes arrived after 2 hours. Significant improvements are greatly needed.
pos,It's really very awesome. Delivery is too early. It's better than FoodPanda.
neg,On pos8.neg6.2negpos9 placed order and after 28 mins later HungryNaki customer care called and said if i continue order it will take 2 more hours to deliver. after cancel i order by foodpanda and food delivered in 4neg mins.

neg,Very disappointing service.delivery man didn?t provide full order & didn?t even refund as advanced payment was done by bcash
neg,worst delivery service waited for 2 hrs for delivery yet no delivery boy came with the delivery and i had to face a lot of problems..

pos,Pathao food is tha best service in Bangladesh.i love pathao food
neg,Delivery was very late and food became cold when received
neg,the delivery guy behaved like an ill mannered bastard
neg,Taste was good enough.But expected faster delivery service.
neg,it was cold and the delivary was very late about(pos:4neg min)
pos,the food men is very gentle and please arrange for them medicle support
neg,late delivery by an hour and it tasted horrible
pos,Excellent service by the deliveryman but the food could have been good according to the price.Although it was good

pos,This is good service.But sometimes we are face some problem.
pos,Fast delivery and do good job
neg,I'm facing a problem. The delivery time is not reducing it's stuck at a particular required time.It happened to me more than twice in this week
pos,I LOVE FOODPANDA
neg,Not good... Voucher should be applicable for every restaurant.. We hate it
neg,My order just got cancelled. But i paid for it. So whn will i get back my money
neg,foodpanda My order got cancelled. But I was charged from my Card. When I'll get refund? My order number: #u8pw-h6hj
neg,Why there is panda offer in uttara only in two restaurant and why there is delivery charge on all restaurant
neg,"Horrible service! Today ordered from Shwapno. That thief delivery man took 5negneg taka and delivered products worth posnegneg taka and ran away with the rest of the money. Since then we are trying to contact foodpanda, but nothing!!!"
neg,Why don't you introduce the Bkash payment system?? Most of the ppl have this account now and they can easily order if you allow this payment ??
pos,"i have been placing quite too many orders recently thru foodpanda for grocery shopping.The best thing beside their service is the behaviour of each and every rider so far i have come across. They r decent, very well mannered and nicely trained. they really deserve immense respect from us for the effort they r putting in, specially during this pandemic. "
pos,"while reading this post ,just felt like sharing this. Best wishes to Foodpanda Family ??"
neg,Please Add Bikash as a payment method.We are facing problem with payment system.Because we are most student.We dont have bank card.We have Bikash.Please add Bikssh as a payment method emergency.Its a emergency need.
neg,You guys are unprofessional. I am trying to order from last night. You accepted and placed the order but then no update. And this repeated today also. You should inform people that you are not available or restaurants are not taking order.
neg,"Your foodpanda riders love to make unnecessary phone calls!! ONLINE order should mean online order and then delivery to the apartment, he has to come and say which apt, the guard will contact the apartment, I have no idea whey they call to say they are in front of the apartment! "
neg,"I have sent email to support, no response. live-chat option from Help-center is unavailable on the help list. I was supposed to get a refund and still did not. Is there no customer support of foodpanda?"
neg,"I ordered a Chinese menu from khatir and the food quality plus taste was not good on top of that they have served me tandoori chicken instead of fried chicken, this has been going on for a while the other day I ordered grilled chicken and the chicken came out half burnt and there?s nothing left to eat, this is because nowadays foodpanda doesn?t make the restaurants accountable for their poor food service, now food panda doesn?t have anyway to call and complain about the service to the customer care, so from now on I will either cook myself or order food from some other agent or will starve to death, but won?t order anything from you. Pathetic service"
pos,Your service is Awsome an fast delivery 
neg,We badly need service in Mirpur pos4 Area.
neg,I have placed order today this evening but without information  the order canceled and i have pay in advance. This is very pathetic... Please let me know immediately about the issue.
neg,Increase your coverage area. Its been a long time but still your service is not available in my area -_-
neg,And some times they Deliver very late.it's so mouch occurred????
neg,So that next time i never order food from there
pos,"Thank you, Foodpanda for going extra mile to give grocery on delivery. Yesterday, I gave the posst order and was very pleased to receive my order in 3neg minutes. You Are the BEST! No other grocery delivery service could beat you at this timing record. Please keep up the great job! ????"
neg,"we have been waiting for the order to get delivered for over 2 hours, the time is just extending in the app. there's no way to contact anyone in foodpanda or the rider... this is really not expected!"
neg,But why you say all the time 5neg % that is not true just say 5neg TK . foodpanda really you are the best ??????
pos,I have been ordering through foodpanda since last two month continuously!! I must admire their service even on this pandemic. Thankyou for being with us ?
neg,Well I?d really appreciate it if foodpanda could extend their services in Paribagh (near central road). The service in this area is terrible ?? . Can hardly order anything ??. Thanks in advance
pos,Great Job food ??..... Really appreciate for Food ?? delivery company.
pos,Foodpanda is great?? Love you so much foodpanda??
neg,Proud! But the neg part is foodpanda doesn't deliver to my doorstep even though i live in populated area
neg,Really poor behavior from rider
neg,Very good behavior from rider ???
neg,Favrt..ordered a lot..why wont?t u come my place..Dakhin Khan..After azampur rail crossing??pls come
neg,Please make sure your riders comply with the guidelines. They DO NOT wear masks. More importantly they don't know how to handle food. My order of dodhi was carried sideways in this tiny schoolbag by the rider who delivered. You guys need some root-level training for the riders!
pos,Thanks foodpanda for excellent service
neg,Our trust on foodpanda has broken. They did fraud and cheated to us. Taken advance money from debit card for home delivery but after 5 hours they haven?t delivery the order. Now they are overturning and accusing self picking order? Who should self picking the food during lockdown though ordered through foodpanda? How ridiculous? They are totally fraud.
pos,Thank you food panda.....we love you for coming to gopalganj...??????
neg,Today I ordered some item for treating my some friend. After 35 minutes waiting....Order was cancelled automatically..... I was in very bad situation with my friends.. .This is not fare.. Foodpanda.....I never order food via foodpandha...
neg,I request foodpanda to make it compulsory for the delivery men to provide us the cash memo or paper of restaurant.
pos,Love you foodpanda?Best offer & best service.

pos,"Just want to appreciate Foodpanda for having a very professional staff on the crew! I ordered food from Pizza Hut and got the wrong delivery. With the immediate action and very customer oriented, Mr. Saad was able to fix the delivery with complimentary. I?m totally happy with the way he dealt with the issue. All the best to Foodpanda team! ??????????????"
neg,Today foodpanda cheated us like any thing he stole my Burger people should know how big theft they are
neg,most of the restaurants remain unavailable all the time why is it so? We the consumers do not except such thing from foodpanda
neg,"Very poor service in deed, ordered food at 5pm and received cold food after 9.3neg. Again foodpanda? -NO."
neg,Terrible customer service.I ordered food for which I had to wait more than 2 hours.There was no communication from their end.I had to constantly call up and ask and they kept saying it will be delivered soon.I am deleting this app immediately and never using this service again.
pos,Best app for food service in Dhaka city.
pos,Very professional and smooth service.App is very useful to pay online and also to track the delivery status and other details.
pos,Just awesome service.Keep it up.App is working good.
neg,Disgusting app.Very unsupportive services.I Would rather be hungry than use your services.Very dissapointed.

pos,"Very much professional,maintain the time,i ordered several time using shohoz app and get it in time."
pos,So  fast service and nice behavior.But did one mistake. Violated delivery button.Without delivered food delivery status updated.That's really bad.
neg,Delivery charge is too high.
pos,food delivery service was good.
pos,Quick delivery...but delivery men need more equipment in this situation...otherwise very good service.
pos,fast delivery Very good.
pos,Very good service!
pos,Prompt service.Happy with the service.
pos,I'm highly appreciate this service app.Easiest processing and fast delivery.Discount offer on food just amazing..I'm in love with it..But sometimes it can't detect the exact location..It could be improved.
neg,"Very bad experience so far.Whereas uber and pathao food gives proper ontime notifications,shohoz doesn't properly.Also other services are prompt and take less than half time than Shohoz.Faced this multiple times and was forced to delete the app."
pos,"Cheaper than other services.But Many times couldn't find any ride after waiting for a long time,that needs to be fixed.Still I am giving you guys full star for being cheaper in the market."
pos,"usually i order food from it,so i dont know about the other services..But the food service is good."
pos,"Delivery time is too long,It must be within 3neg min."
neg,Awful app with awful service.It takes you around 4neg minutes just to confirm an order lol All the best.Also the app takes long time to enter the food section as it keeps on saying'Location not ready'whereas my location is turned on.
neg,Food service doesn't respond and soon closes showing GPS problem while other apps are running side by side with other services.Do take some measures.TIA.
neg,"A great overall app,considering the fact it picked up late.But,they need to improve the food service."
pos,It's very fast in order and delivery.It saves time and money.I like the app a lot.Thanks Shohoz.
neg,"Slow app,promo code cannot be added in the checkout page,location identification problem and super slow service."
neg,Service is good enough but after the last update food tracking feature isn't working.
pos,I am truly satisfied with Shohoz.
neg,Lots of problems in their food service..waited for long time but there is no response from rider...Their customer care service is also very very poor..Tried a lot of times but response..Its happenings everday in a regular bases.They are giving discounts but they are not maintaining the sevice at all..
pos,I just love this app awesome experience never cheated with foods like quantity prob.quality.never neg as like food panda n the coupon system is my favourite side.it's saves my lot of money.
pos,Loved the fact that you guys offered me a free coupon of 2neg% discount when the food was late to arrive for the rain.This is what I call an excellent customer service.You are my most favourite app for ordering food.Keep up the good work.
neg,The food option was showing unavailable.Poor service.It takes lot of time.
neg,Shohoz does not give full location coverage to dhaka university area.Authority should improve it.
neg,So neg...never gonna use this app again...after placing my order I waited for 45 minutes and then they called me to inform that it wasn't available!!!Seriously it took them 45 minutes to realise that item wasn't available!!!Disgusting service.
neg,Faced problem with your map location.Customer service is not good...I can hear all the conversation of other employees when I talked with customer care executive.Otherwise service is good.
neg,sohoz food sucks.It took more an hour and 3neg minutes for my food to be delivered.Then i received the wrong food when i finally got it.By then I was already so frustrated.Many functions of the app still does not work.Ii is better to use Pathao or Foodpanda.
neg,"They daily give many offers and make us greedy about all the tasty food.But most of the offers are fake.When we order after that the man receives the order or they say""your order has been accepted""but even after 2 hrs it stays the same.And even if the man receives the order than also after a couple of minutes it gets cancelled by them.And then if we call the customer care then they say they will check and reply but never reply."
pos,Love their service.They give lots of special discounts along with discount coupons.
neg,"Not at all satisfied.Ordered several times,always cancel."
pos,Nice app Good Delivery.
pos,Awesome performance and awesome service.
pos,Very prompt service-indeed Shohoz.
pos,"There service is nice,it's cheaper then pathao i like this apps."
pos,The food delivery is exactly on time and also got discount on first order.It has been a great experience.
neg,Utterly disgusting service.No available food carrier and no way to track progress.Takes payment in advance but doesn't refund even after cancellation of service.Recommended to avoid this service.
neg,I complained several times about the over charge but seems like they have nothing to do except saying sorry.Poor service.
neg,Worst service ever.Even after pos hour from the food order i did not got the food and when i called your call centre your customer executive told me that only 3negmin passed till then.but I had documents in app and my call list my order time and your confirmation call it was already 65 min passed...
pos,The service is doing good after the complaint.Appreciate it.
pos,very fast and smart service.
pos,Very easy & very good service.
pos,Happy with the service so far.Good luck!
neg,It takes more than one hour to accept and confirm a food order.
neg,This is the worst app I have ever used.Their service is too immature and unprofessional.I ordered food through this app three times and in all cases they have cancelled the order for respective reasons.Too much poor app.
neg,Very slow service.Needs to improve food delivery services.
neg,Stupid service ever..most of time canceled order after payment.
neg,useless restaurants are getting easy access to shohoz..when i call customer service no one picks up for 5 mins to posneg mins straight plus the extra call charge goes to complete waste..what a shame
neg,very time consuming service!
pos,Want more voucher.But all services are Good.
neg,"I live in Mohammadpur but once i was able to order from dhanmondi....but now i can't{I ordered from lalbagh biriyani house,dhanmondi.}"
neg,They accepted my food order then there were no updates from them even after pos hour.They confirmed my order through phone call but there was no update in the app.I even called them later after pos hour but no call received from their side as if they were trolling around.I suggest stay away from this app and service.
pos,By this app i start order food online.It makes me comfortable in my life.Very frankly service and careful.
neg,worst food app ever with worst service and customer care service....extremely neg...not recommended at all...
pos,"Good apps,,good service."
pos,Love their food delivery service and offers.
neg,show not service available in Chittagong when it's important for me.suck
pos,Good and great service apps
neg,Bad service ever...irritating...
neg,TOTALLY RUBBISH SERVICE.THIS SERVICE WAITING TIME TAKE TOO MUCH HUGE.
pos,Very well apps i happy for good service.
neg,I have ordered food many a time but after sometime the rider tell restaurant have run out of the item.
pos,Helpful service in the urgent moment.
neg,Extremely poor service.I will never use the app.
neg,Very poor experience and delivery time is too much late.
neg,"One of the disgusting app ever,when u need they are out of services."
neg,Very slow service
neg,Delivery is super slow
neg,App is good.But their service is poor.
pos,Time save & Money save
pos,There service so good
neg,Very late customer care service
pos,Very good service.
neg,"Sohoz food service is worst.Restaurant Rating & Pictures of food is needed.The app doesn't keep updated information about food.After ordering they say""it's out of stock"".The system of cancellation of an order is also difficult.It cannot detect the exact location.Manual location can't be selected."
neg,"If food is wrong or bad,they don;t give refunds.This is very bad."
neg,one of the bestest poor sevice ever
neg,"Other food delivery services are much better than this,it kept me waiting for about 2.5 hours and still I did not get the food delivered and took my payment.I suggest that people should stop using this app and find more suitable options."
pos,"I haven't used any other services except food delivery.At first,it wasn't good at all.But over time,it improved.at least in my area,mohammadpur.Gave 4 star rating because i know shohoz food section has room for development.For example,if a restaurant is closed or a item is sold out for the day,these are not shown on the app.As a result,both deliveryman and customer has to suffer and time of both are wasted.Please take a look at this and I'll give 5 stars."
neg,Bad service and very annoying.
neg,negly they don't have any kind of customer service for their food delivery.
neg,Very poor customer service.I applied my promo but it didn't work so i had to pay extra.When i complained i wasn't given the money back instead the service was disgusting.
neg,unprofessional service.The worst food delivery service ever!
neg,"Food service is just horrible.I ordered today at pos8pos6 hrs,but there was no response upto pos92neghrs.I called the delivery man,he told he is offline and he can't delivery now!I called customer care 3 times,but they couldn't do a single thing other than saying sorry.They couldn't even shift the order to the other delivery man.They did one thing.That is ,they cancelled my order after pos and half hr."
neg,"While placing order on prepayment,maximum time delivery man cancelled the order telling that item not available despite item available at restaurant.Complaining at Customer Care,no action is taken.Also money has been blocked for several days i.e refund made after a week."
pos,"Shohoz provides excellent service.So far,I am very satisfied with their behaviour.The best part about Shohoz is it has a wide range of options to choose from at reasonable rates.Unlike Foodpanda,which connects one mostly to the expensive restaurants.Shohoz connects its customers even with restaurants offering good food at comparatively lower price.This has given me an opportunity to taste the Biryanis and Pulaos of different restaurants without feeling guilty of over-spending."
neg,"Shohoz food has terrible services.Sometimes their rider will tell you that restaurant has no food and request you to cancel order.If you don't do it,they will cancel it.If you already paid the amount by card or bkash,they will assure that will be refunded.But actually they will not.If you complain them regarding not getting the refund,they will say it is under process.During morning time,the rider will bring breakfast so late that you have to leave for office without having the food."
neg,"one of the most unprofessional services i have ever used.For food,even if the customer care calls to confirm the order they process it really slowly.And then the delivery man will most likely cancel it.Riders are rude and unprofessional.The delivery service is a joke.I would posnegneg% advice not to use this app to order food.Very poor service quality."
neg,"ordered food from their app,they accepted and processed the order and cancelled the order after 45 minutes.It was past office lunch hours and they said'the restaurant was out of stock'.If they were out of stock,why did they take 45 minutes to inform?It takes 45 minutes to deliver the food!utterly neg by their service and communication."
neg,Extremely bad service.
neg,entered address Dhanmondi and they say they don't delivery there!! there service isn't available there yet!they are expanding soon! I mean seriously!! if they don't deliver at Dhanmondi area then where are theirdelivery service available??!! but their website says completely opposite. their service is available at Dhanmondi area. 
pos,"I have always got fast delivery and hot food,Hope foodpanda always keep up there great service."
neg,"I have given my address and they accepted. Later they were showing that they have delivered but it was not. I contacted with the helpline and they said 5 minutes. After 2 hours of delivery time, they said that it"
neg,Ordered my breakfast in the morning and received after 2pm.dude improve this.
neg,We don?t deliver in this area...then where do you deliver????
neg,"There foods are good ,but sometym there deliveryy system is too bad."
neg,Every time when I order foodman cancel my order

neg,Rider doesn't know which order is mine..funny
neg,I think this delivery guy ate a slice from my pizza!
neg,"To the rider,don't jerk the food"

neg,"If you want to have food from here ,keep in mind they will deliver it after pos.3neg hour then the time frame"
neg,They didn?t deliver my Food !!!!

pos,Delivery was good and food was warm enough but it does taste average.
neg,Horrible service. I ordered a week ago and it took an hour and half. I ordered today and it?s been over 2 hours. Still no food. Highly Unrecommended. They should not be serving areas that take them so long to deliver.

neg,They must be punctual. The rider came with a normal Backpack carrying food with no mask and gloves
neg,I can't get food after pos.5 hours it's so weird there service too poor

neg,They didnt even told me that they are not going deliver my food.
neg,Didn?t get food yet . Delayed pos hour and still didn?t inform anything about delivery nor did they inform cancellation.
neg,Poor service
neg,The rider was very bad
neg,Rider losing time
neg,Rider and packing were so bad! Rider?s phone have no balance! He calls me from other people number! He has no extra 2negtk! So I took my order by posnegnegtk where it was 78tk! I?ll not buy anything from foodpanda!
neg,"I asked for pos Litre Borhani which cost pos2neg taka, where as Foodpanda rider get a Sprite of 5negneg ml which cost 35 taka, and end of the day loss is mine because he cannot pay me Back.... that was really bad"
neg,Yah its good! But too late to delivery!
neg,"I have a complain. The rider that serve this order, he is mental. The food that I have order, this food is still have on this restaurant. But he says me over the phone that the food that you have order, this are not in the restaurant. But I have already paid the amount with my digital payment."

neg,Max Riders are big spoiler of food hygiene.
neg,Your deliverer hardly understand the adress.. My adress from your restaurant is not very far..
neg,And easy location to find. But they can't understand. I ordered many times. Face the same problem every time.
neg,Deliveryman didn?t give us tomatoe sause or meinian sause.
